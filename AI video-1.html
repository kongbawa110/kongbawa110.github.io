<h1> AI video:</h1>
<p>In recent years, working from home has become increasingly popular among employees and employers. While there are certainly benefits to working remotely, there are also some drawbacks that should be considered. One of the main benefits of working from home is the flexibility it offers. Employees who work from home are often able to set their own schedules, which can be especially helpful for those who have families or other responsibilities. Additionally, remote work eliminates the need for commuting, which can save time and reduce stress. Many people also find that they are more productive when working from home, since there are fewer distractions and interruptions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically,this video will tell benefit and drawback of online work.</p>

<p>benefits of Pictory.AI&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatically create short, highly-sharable branded videos from your long form content. Quick, easy &amp; cost-effective. No technical skills or software download required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are a team of entrepreneurs, marketers, and engineers who have started companies, and also worked at large and small enterprises. As prolific content creators, we realized that many businesses are sitting on mountains of long-form content in the form of blogs, white-papers, articles, demos, and webinars. But, what the world is consuming is short-form videos! What if we could use AI to convert long-form content into hundreds of short-form multimedia content pieces? We could not only solve the problem of generating fresh content but also offer higher engagement levels on social media through video. We built our first prototype at a hackathon in Seattle in 2019. In July 2020, we launched the first version of our product. Since then, we have made many updates to Pictory and we continue to listen to our customers and innovate. We are on a mission to convert verbosity to visual brevity.&nbsp;</p>
